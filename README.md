# Discord AI Agent

<br />

## 📙 Features
You can scheduled events just by normal chatting with our bot and you can:

- **Create** events even by _adding someone via email, create google meeting room_ and all the neccessary features.
- **Find** upcoming events.
- **Update** & **Delete** existing events.
- **Create Quick** events.
- **Remove attendee** from an event

<br />

## 🤔 How I used composio?
**Composio** was very _crucial and reliable tool_ for making my project. It helped me to make my agentic tools for the agent **much more faster** and **in an easy way** acting like a **pipeline** between _agent_ and _google calendar_. It would really took me many more days if done without this 🔥.
